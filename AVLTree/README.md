It's my training project. It was created on 28.05.2019. 
In this project I tryed realize AVL-tree by class
It has 3 kind of initialization by other AVL-tree, by operator = and defalt by creating empty tree.
It has commands "insert", "remove" and "find" and commands "print", "empty" and "size", that prints on at the screan all elements of tree, returns true if tree empty, and return count of elements of tree.
