It's my training project. It was created on 11.11.2018. 
I make priority queue by heap.
It works by file system: input in file "priorityqueue.in", output in file "priorityqueue.out".
It has 3 command: "push", "extract-min", "decrease-key". 
Command "push" adds element in priority queue. 
Command "extract-min" extracts element from priority queue. 
Command "decrease-key" changes a key with smaller key.
