This list represents keywords allowed to be passed to the method as first 
parameter, or types of SQLite database engine's objects. After some node is 
selected, DataGrid displays the collection returned by GetSchema('selected 
node'). In the PropertyGrid there are restrictions list for selected object. You 
can assign any restrictions and click the 'Refresh' button. For example, specify 
only Owner = sys for Tables and click 'Refresh' to see all tables of the user sys in the DataGrid.</P>";
