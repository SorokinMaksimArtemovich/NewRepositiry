    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What is the difference between the Standard and Professional editions?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      The free Standard Edition represents a fully-featured ADO.NET data provider with design time support
      and advanced classes. The Professional Edition adds more classes, tools, technologies,
      and integration capabilities.
      The following list briefly enumerates main advantages of Professional Edition.
      <ul class="disc">
        <li><b>Entity Framework support</b> allows you to employ the latest conceptual technology from Microsoft.</li>
        <li><b>LinqConnect support</b> allows you to focus on objects instead of relational data in database application development.</li>
        <li>The <b>SQLiteDump class</b> serves to store a database or its parts as a script and to restore database
          from the generated script.</li>
        <li>The <b>DataLink class</b> serves for universal cross-form data binding.</li>
        <li>The powerful <b>SQLiteDataTable component</b> as all-in-one table data access solution.</li>
        <li>The <b>SQLiteDataSet class</b> allows using typed and untyped provider-specific datasets.</li>
        <li><b>DataSet Wizard</b> greatly simplifies process of generating datasets in your application.</li>
        <li><b>DataSet Manager</b> and <b>DataSet Editor</b> help managing the datasets.</li>
        <li>Support for <b>dbMonitor</b> that performs per-component tracing of database events such as
          SQL statement execution, commit, rollback, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Enterprise Library</b> support allows you to take advantage of Data Access Application Block functionality.</li>
        <li><b>ASP.NET 2.0 providers</b> support allows using the data provider in ASP.NET 2.0 provider model.</li>
		<li><b>Sync Framework</b> support allows using dotConnect for SQLite for synchronizing 
			SQLite data with other data sources.</li>
      </ul>
      To test this functionality use the Trial Edition, which incorporates all aforementioned features.

<span id="Category">Installation and deployment</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I installed dotConnect for SQLite trial, then I have bought and
      installed purchased version, but something went wrong.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Make sure you had uninstalled the trial version correctly.
      There should be no old (trial) assemblies present in your system. Uninstall
      dotConnect for SQLite and check your Global Assembly Cache and local folders for
      Devart.* assemblies. Remove all Devart.* files and reinstall
      dotConnect for SQLite.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade to a newer version of dotConnect for SQLite?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Close all running IDEs and help collections, then run the installation package of the newer version. 
    You will be prompted to uninstall the previous version; agree and then proceed to installing the newer build.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">You say, there are sample projects, but I can't find any.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you installed dotConnect for SQLite not in typical mode. Please choose
    <b>typical</b> when installing dotConnect for SQLite. All samples are installed by default in
    <i>\Program Files\Devart\dotConnect\SQLite\Samples</i> folder.</span>
  </li>  

 <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Are there any restrictions for Visual Studio Express editions?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Yes, there are some. First, the provider add-in (and hence menu item) is not available.
      Second, components are not registered in toolbox automatically (though you can do it manually). Finally,

  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I deploy my application?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>To deploy an application written with dotConnect for SQLite, you need to:</p>
      <ul class="disc">
        <li>deploy the Devart runtime assemblies used by your application;</li>
        <li>include the technical license resource;</li>
        <li>in case your application uses provider factories, you also need to expose dotConnect for SQLite to the system.</li>

      <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade my projects from dotConnect for SQLite 1.xx?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>
    In this release there were some important name changes in the product.
Particularly, assemblies, namespaces, invariant name, and some types
were changed as follows:<br>

<i>"CoreLab.Data"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data";</i><br>
<i>"CoreLab.SQLite"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.SQLite";</i><br>
<i>"SQLiteDirectFactory"</i> became <i>"SQLiteProviderFactory";</i><br>
<i>Invariant name</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.SQLite";</i></p>

<p>Your projects must be updated to be compatible with dotConnect for SQLite 2.0. Here is the list of files you should update:<br>
<i>*.csproj, *.vbproj</i> - references to assemblies<br>
<i>*.cs, *.vb</i> - namespaces<br>
<i>*.licx</i> - namespaces and assembly names<br>
<i>Web.config</i> - assembly names and web provider types</p>
<p>
This is done automatically when you invoke the Upgrade wizard from Visual Studio menu: <i>Tools | SQLite | Upgrade Wizard</i>.
    </p>
  </span>
  </li>

    <li>
        <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have received a message that Devart.Data is incompatible...</span><br>
  <span class="A">
Devart data providers use a common assembly (Devart.Data.dll), so it is necessary to install compatible providers versions. We release our ADO.NET data providers in a single pack, thus releases from the same date should be compatible. Also, Devart data providers should warn you before installation if an incompatible version of Devart.Data.dll was detected.
  </span>

  </li>

  <li><span id="Qx" class="Q">I can not open database file... What am I to do?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
<p>Maybe the <i>sqlite3.dll</i> file is missing. You should make sure your system has acces to this file by checking if it is available in the folder with the database or in the <i>\WINDOWS\system32\</i> folder. </p>
  </span></li>

  <li><span id="Qx" class="Q">Can I use the <i>sqlite3.dll</i> downloaded from SQLite homepage?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
<p><i>sqlite3.dll</i> included with the dotConnect to SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA defined.
It allows using sqlite3_column_database_name, sqlite3_column_table_name, and sqlite3_column_origin_name functions, which are necessary for building correct DML statements for a result set with aliases used. 
If you want to use SQLite from its official website, you need to download its sources and compile it with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA defined.</p>
  </span></li>
  
  <li>
        <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have received the following message - &quot;error 0175: The specified store provider cannot be found in the configuration, or is not valid..&quot;. 
        What does it mean and what should I do?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
<p>You should put the <i>Devart.Data</i>, <i>Devart.Data.SQLite</i>, and <i>Devart.Data.SQLite.Entity.EF<b>&lt;Version&gt;</b></i>
			assemblies in the Bin folder of your application (or place these assemblies in Global
			Assembly Cache). The <b>&lt;Version&gt;</b> here is the version of Entity Framework used 
			in your application. For Entity Framework v1 the assembly is called 
			Devart.Data.SQLite.Entity.EF1.dll, for Entity Framework v4 and v5 it is 
			Devart.Data.SQLite.Entity.EF4.dll, for Entity Framework v6 it is 
			Devart.Data.SQLite.Entity.EF6.dll. For Entity Framework Core it is 
			Devart.Data.SQLite.Entity.EFCore.dll.
Make sure that your application is licensed correctly (take a look at the <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/docs/Licensing.html">Licensing</a> article for more information). </p>
<p>Information about provider registering is available in the <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/docs/Deployment.html">Deployment</a> article.</p>

  <span class="A">
  <p><a name="subscriptionprogram"></a>The <b>dotConnect for SQLite Subscription Program</b> is an annual maintenance and support service
          for dotConnect for SQLite users.</p>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Can I use my version of dotConnect for SQLite after my Subscription expires?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>Yes, you can. dotConnect for SQLite version licenses are perpetual.</p>
  </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Do I need a new subscription to use dotConnect for SQLite 5?</span><br>

  </span>
  </li>
</ol>


<span id="Category">Technical Licensing</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What is the licensing you use?</span><br>
    <span class="A">dotConnect for SQLite uses .NET component licensing. To build operational
      application dotConnect for SQLite requires valid license. If no license is available,
      dotConnect for SQLite does not work.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to embed license into my application?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Usually you do not have to care about embedding license in your application.
      When you install dotConnect for SQLite the system is configured so that licensing is done
      transparently. License is automatically added to project when you place a SQLiteConnection
      component onto a form.<br />
      In some cases you have to manually add license. It is necessary for console applications,
      class libraries, and some ASP.NET applications. For instructions on how to add license manually refer to
      <script>
      if (RunningInHost()) {
        document.write("<a href='Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");
      } else {

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening connection I get an exception saying "License not found...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This generally indicates that license information could not be found, or you try to
      apply it in some way that does not suit the kind of application. For example:</p>
      <ul class="disc">
        <li>File <i>licenses.licx</i>, required for dotConnect for SQLite to function properly, could not be found.</li>
        <li>File <i>licenses.licx</i> is not added as embedded resource.</li>
        <li>File <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> not found in ASP.NET applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To fix the problem determine type of your application and read corresponding section of "Licensing" topic.</p>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening connection I get an exception saying "License not valid...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This means that license information was found but it is incorrect. It usually happens in the following cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The project was earlier compiled with old or trial version of dotConnect for SQLite. </li>
        <li>File <i>licenses.config</i> used by a class library does not refer to launched executable.</li>
        <li>The <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> belongs to other application or needs to be recompiled.</li>
        <li>Something's wrong with the operating system or installation of dotConnect for SQLite.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you encounter one of these problems, do the following (the numbers of actions correspond to the numbers of the problems in the above list):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delete all files from the bin and obj folders and rebuild the project.</li>
        <li>Specify the executable in the licenses.config file.</li>
        <li>Rebuild App_Licenses.dll for the current application.</li>
        <li>Perform the following steps:
          <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
            <li>uninstall dotConnect for SQLite;</li>
            <li>remove all Devart.* and policy.*.Devart.* files from the GAC;</li>
            <li>clear the <i>Program Files\Devart\dotConnect</i> and <i>Program Files\Common Files\Devart\dotConnect</i> folders;</li>
            <li>re-install dotConnect for SQLite.</li>

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Deployed application worked fine some time, but in some moment it started
      to say "Sorry, your trial period has expired". But I do not use trial version any more.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you compiled the application with Trial edition of dotConnect for SQLite,
      and deployed it with assemblies from non-trial version. In this case time limit is actual
      as well. To eliminate the problem just recompile the project.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to license ASP.NET applications?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>To support server-side compilation you ought to have special assembly <b>App_Licenses.dll</b>
      in the <b>Bin</b> directory of your site. To create this assembly execute <b>Build
      Runtime Licenses</b> command in the licenses.licx file context menu in the <b>Solution
      Explorer</b> view. Required assembly will be created automatically.</p>

      <p>Note that this is not necessary for precompiled ASP.NET applications (if nothing is
      compiled on server by user request). Precompiled applications are licensed as usual applications.</p>

      <p>To do this install dotConnect for SQLite on same computer where SQL Server 2008 resides.</p>

  <span id="Qx" class="Q">I am having problems with the licensing in my project... What am I to do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
    <p>If any problems with licensing occurred in your project, you should use the License Information dialog to resolve them. You can access it from the Visual Studio menu: <i>Tools | SQLite | License Information</i>.</p>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Do end-users need a license?</span><br>
    <span class="A">No, end-users of your application do not require any license.</span>

<span id="Category">Connection pooling</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I call SQLiteConnection.Open(), then Close().
      The database file is still locked by my application. Isn't it a bug?</span><br>
    <span class="A">No, it is not. This is Connection Pooling feature. Actual connection is not closed in
      order to be used later by your application. This boosts performance greatly.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get exception "Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed..."
      What to do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">The full text of the exception is "Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to
      obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in
      use and max pool size was reached." It clearly states that you have run out of connections available.
      To solve the problem increase <i>Max Pool Size</i> connection string parameter value. The default
      value is 100. Another way to get extra connections is to clear one or all of the pools. Or you can
      turn connection pooling off using <i>Pooling</i> connection string parameter.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to prevent possible pooling problems?</span><br>
    <span class="A">You can clear the pool explicitly. Generally pool is cleared automatically
      when connections are idle or closed by the server. To force the operation call ClearPool or
      ClearAllPools methods. Another solution is to disable the pool at all (set <i>Pooling=false</i>
      in connection string). If this does not help, the problem is not caused by pooling.</span>

<span id="Category">Documentation problems</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to open documentation on dotConnect for SQLite?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      There are several ways to open dotConnect for SQLite documentation:
      <ul class="disc">
        <li>Use appropriate shortcut in start menu, for instance,
            <i>Start - Programs - Devart dotConnect for SQLite - Documentation</i>.</li>
        <li>Use command in the IDE: <i>Tools - SQLite - dotConnect for SQLite Help</i>.</li>
        <li>Position cursor on some class from Devart.Data.SQLite and press F1.</li>
      </ul>
      There is also same documentation in chm format. You can download it from our site at the following address:
      <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/dcsqlite.chm">www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/dcsqlite.chm</a>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I can't see the documentation in Visual Studio Help Collection.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Correctly installed documentation appears as separate node in combined collection
      of Visual Studio and Delphi. If you can't find <b>dotConnect for SQLite</b> node
      there it is because you enabled topics filtering. To reveal the node set filter to <i>"Devart
      Documentation"</i>, or <i>"(unfiltered)"</i>, or <i>"Visual C#"</i> etc.<br>
      Another possible reason is that you installed some IDE after installation of dotConnect for SQLite.
      In this case use aforementioned methods to reach documentation.</span>

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">All topics in CHM file are blank.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This can happen due to some patches from Microsoft installed on your system.
      Please read <a href="https://forums.devart.com/viewtopic.php?t=2461">this page</a> to find possible solutions
      for the problem. In most cases it is enough to right-click on the CHM file, select Properties, click on the
      "Unblock" button and click "Apply" to show the contents.

<span id="Category">ORM solutions</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Are LINQ to SQLite and Entity Framework supported?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      The Professional Edition of dotConnect for SQLite supports both LinqConnect (formerly called LINQ to SQLite) and the
      latest version of ADO.NET Entity Framework.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Where do I start with Entity Framework or LinqConnect?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      For your convenience there are brief tutorials that you can use to get acquainted with the technologies:
      <ul class="disc">
         <li>
          <script>
          if (RunningInHost()) {
            document.write("<a href=\"Tutorial_EF.html\">Entity Framework Tutorial</a>");
          } else {

      </ul>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Are there any demo projects to play with?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      Yes, dotConnect for SQLite includes several Entity Framework and LinqConnect samples in
      C# and Visual Basic. The samples demonstrate how to use several entities
      and a relationship between them. You can also download separate
      <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/efquerysamples.zip">Entity
      Framework Query Samples</a> package, which is a standard Microsoft demo with
      added SQLite connectivity.

<span id="Category">Miscellaneous</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get concurrency error when modifying records using SQLiteDataAdapter
      or SQLiteDataTable. What can be wrong?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      This can happen when SQLiteCommandBuilder generates a query without primary key field.
      To avoid it use custom update command instead of generated by SQLiteCommandBuilder.
      This problem should not take place if primary key field participates in SELECT statement.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">No components can be found in the toolbox.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This can happen if the installation encountered some problems. You can add the
      components to toolbox manually. This procedure is described in the <script>
      if (RunningInHost()) {
        document.write("<a href='installation.html'>Installation</a>");
      } else {
        document.write("<a href='http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/docs/?installation.html'>Installation</a>");
      }
      </script><noscript>
      <i>Installation</i>
      </noscript> article
      in the documentation. Note that Microsoft Web Developer 2008 Express edition does not allow
      working with toolbox at all.</span>

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">dotConnect for SQLite components in Visual Studio 2008 are grey...</span><br>
    <span class="A">Make sure you're in <i>Component Designer</i> view. Do not confuse with <i>Designer</i>
      view. To switch between views use context menu of .aspx file in Solution Explorer. This relates to Web projects only.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) can't get the list of tables in my SQLite database.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This is an architecture limitation from Microsoft, SSIS understands metadata of SQL Server only.
      To circumvent this you have to write queries manually.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Can I use dotConnect for SQLite assemblies in the x64 process?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>dotConnect for SQLite assemblies are built with the /platform:anycpu option. 
    So, you can use provider's assemblies on any platform (x86 or x64). 
    For more information, refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zekwfyz4.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zekwfyz4.aspx</a></p>
    <p>However, you need to ensure that you are using the compatible version of the engine library sqlite3.dll. The engine library version of the proper capacity is deployed during installation of dotConnect for SQLite depending on the target machine capacitity (e.g., the 64-bit version is deployed onto 64-bit machines).</p></span>
